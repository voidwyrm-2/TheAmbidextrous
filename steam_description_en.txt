A absurdly speedy scug with (I think?)Gourmand spear damage
he starts in that little shelter in the wall(picture attached)
yes, he is literally ambidextrous(he can hold a spear, a rarefaction cell, or squidcada in each hand)
he can also maul
this was just a scug I made to test custom hooks, but now he's my oc so that worked out in his favor

coming soon:
spawning with a pearl in your stomach which you must take to 5P(probably too lazy to actually make a cutscene or anything)
being able to go through the MS gate
secret scug
other things(?)
